# Description
An interpreter for a custom pseudo-code-esque language built using recursive descent parsing to execute the code line-by-line including a tokenizer (lexical analysis), parsing (syntax analysis along with semantic analysis), parse tree generator, and interpretation (executor). 

# How to run and test

Run the .sh scripts using `./tester.sh` within Tests directory to individually test each key component of the interpreter.
